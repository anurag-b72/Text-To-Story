The Little Mermaid, Coral, longed to see the world above the waves.  She spent her days listening to her grandmother's stories of sun-drenched shores and shimmering cities. One day, Coral saw a human boy caught in a storm.  She bravely swam to him and pushed him to safety. The boy, grateful, promised to find a way to thank her.  Coral, though she couldn't speak, understood his kind heart.  Later, when the boy returned, he brought a beautiful shell, a gift from the sea.  Coral, overjoyed, knew that even though she could never leave the ocean, she had found a friend in the world above.
